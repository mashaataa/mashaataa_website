title: "Fun stuff"

My name is **Mariia Atamaniuk**. I am a professional analyst with 5+ years of experience in market research, product and customer analytics, as well as in investment projects.

### Intro

Experienced in SQL (PostgreSQL), R (RStudio), and Tableau...

Wait. *Are you bored already?* I know. Sorry for that. **This page is for things that I will not include in my resume**.

### First serious assignment

I was 18, when I had my first serious job at the British-Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce. After only three months of working there I was appointed to be a **main organizer of the dinner for the President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko** in 2018 with 20 biggest investors in Ukraine in the awesome Armourer's Hall.

*If I were my boss, I would hesitate to appoint a 18-year old intern to organize one of the most important events at the organization, but I did well! Look!*

### Investment talks

Besides organizing conferences, I was also attending them - to meet new people and having fun arranging new business. During past couple of years, **I have attended more than 100 conferences**, workshops, webinars, and networking events.

*But to be honest, I am there only for food.*

### Whisperer

My friend has a YouTube channel with ASMR content, and I participated in two of her videos. Together, these two videos gathered about **half a million views**.

*I am truly flattered that people enjoy watching me enjoying tingles!*

### Jokes accountancy

As the classic has once said, "life is a joke, and I am laughing, even though I did not understand the humour".

Two years ago, I launched a **private telegram channel** where I wrote down jokes that I heard around me: mostly from my friends. So far, there are **12,635 jokes** and I want to stop.

*But I can't*.

### Mess management

With a group of friends, we once decided to organize a techno festival on Troeshchyna, in the abandoned church at the edge of Kyiv. We agreed with a local security guy for a box of vodka that he allows us to do this.

Spoiler: it didn't happen. Person responsible for DJs went crazy (literally) and dropped out.

*The venue was amazing for such festival.*

### Metal friend

I had bunch of different hobbies in my life, i.e. piano, web-design, chess, sports. I loved working out at the gym, but it became pretty annoying to repeat the same exercises again and again. I wanted to transform sport into art. And - started pole dancing.

*If you are considering doing it as well, please note that as a byproduct you may receive nasty comments in your DM.*

### Stolen cake

Once I solicited my friend to pretend that he had a birthday to get a free cake from a cafe. They brought us cheesecake. It was very tasty, thank you for asking. And no, we do not regret it.

*And by the way, this is my photo on film. Hashtag 35 mm.*

### Biggest achievement in life

Sometimes, when I have a bad mood, I start thinking about my *non-existing* achievements in life and become sad. But then I recall that last year a team of my sister and me took a first prize in **pétanque competition** and won over skilled Armenians who spend each weekend in the golf club.

*If you have no idea what pétanque is - don't ask me. I don't know too.*
