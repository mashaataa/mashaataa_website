I am a professional analyst with 5+ years of experience in market research, product and customer analytics, as well as in investment projects.\n\nExperienced in SQL (PostgreSQL), R (RStudio), and Tableau...\n\nWait. *Are you bored already?* I know. Sorry for that. **This page is for things that I will not include in my resume** (even though I am looking for a job, so please [find my CV](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mashaataa/) and/or contact me [in telegram](https://t.me/mashaataa)).\n\n### First serious assignment\n\nI was 18, when I had my first serious job at the British-Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce. After only three months of working there I was appointed to be a **main organizer of the dinner for the President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko** in 2018 with 20 biggest investors in Ukraine in the awesome Armourer's Hall.\n\n*If I were my boss, I would hesitate to appoint a 18-year old intern to organize one of the most important events at the organization, but I did well! Look!*\n\n![](Poroshenko.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n### Investment talks\n\nBesides organizing conferences, I was also attending them - to meet new people and having fun arranging new business. During past couple of years, **I have attended more than 100 conferences**, workshops, webinars, and networking events.\n\n*But to be honest, I am there only for food.*\n\n![](eating.jpeg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n### Whisperer\n\nMy friend has a YouTube channel with ASMR content, and I participated in two of her videos. Together, these two videos gathered about **half a million views**.\n\n*I am truly flattered that people enjoy watching me enjoying tingles!*\n\n![](images/Screenshot%202022-06-12%20at%2019.43.57.png)\n\n### Jokes accountancy\n\nAs the classic has once said, \"life is a joke, and I am laughing, even though I did not understand the humour\".\n\nTwo years ago, I launched a **private telegram channel** where I wrote down jokes that I heard around me: mostly from my friends. So far, there are **12,635 jokes** and I want to stop.\n\n*But I can't*.\n\n![](images/Screenshot%202022-06-12%20at%2021.57.20.png)\n\n### Mess management \n\nWith a group of friends, we once decided to organize a techno festival on Troeshchyna, in the abandoned church at the edge of Kyiv. We agreed with a local security guy for a box of vodka that he allows us to do this.\n\nSpoiler: it didn't happen. Person responsible for DJs went crazy (literally) and dropped out.\n\n*The venue was amazing for such festival.*\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n![](str.jpg)\n\n![](str2.jpg)\n:::\n\n### Metal friend\n\nI had bunch of different hobbies in my life, i.e. piano, web-design, chess, sports. I loved working out at the gym, but it became pretty annoying to repeat the same exercises again and again. I wanted to transform sport into art. And - started pole dancing.\n\n*If you are considering doing it as well, please note that as a byproduct you may receive nasty comments in your DM.*\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n![](pole1.jpg){width=\"268\"}\n\n![](pole2.jpg){width=\"268\"}\n:::\n\n### Stolen cake\n\nOnce I solicited my friend to pretend that he had a birthday to get a free cake from a cafe. They brought us cheesecake. It was very tasty, thank you for asking. And no, we do not regret it.\n\n*And by the way, this is my photo on film. Hashtag 35 mm.*\n\n![](images/001099620030.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n### Biggest achievement in life\n\nSometimes, when I have a bad mood, I start thinking about my *non-existing* achievements in life and become sad. But then I recall that last year a team of my sister and me took a first prize in **pétanque competition** and won over skilled Armenians who spend each weekend in the golf club.\n\n*If you have no idea what pétanque is - don't ask me. I don't know too.*\n\n![](pet.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"350\"}\n\n### Outro\n\nLife is a beautiful mess.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"about.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"0.9.563","editor":"visual","theme":"litera","title":"Fun stuff"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
