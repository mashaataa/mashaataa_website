I was born and live in **Kyiv** (Ukraine) - the capital of great people! Unfortunately, we have a noisy southern neighbor so we are sorry for the inconveniences if you decide to visit Ukraine now.

```{r}
#| column: screen-inset-shaded
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=30.5234, lat=50.4501, popup="The birthplace of Mariia")
```

### Plots

As a data analyst, I am building nice graphs. It is my job to do so. By the way, these are not my graphs.

```{r}
#| column: screen-inset-shaded
#| layout-nrow: 1
#| echo: false

plot(cars)
plot(iris)
plot(pressure)
```

### SQL

SQL is a bread and butter of the data analyst. Please find below some examples of my previous code. For example, how I calculated conversion chart for monthly registration cohorts.

`SELECT DATE_PART('year', registration_date) AS year,` `DATE_PART ('month', registration_date) AS month,` `COUNT(*) AS registered_count,` `COUNT(CASE WHEN first_order_date IS null` `THEN customer_id END) AS no_sale,` `COUNT(CASE WHEN first_order_date - registration_date < INTERVAL '3' day` `THEN customer_id END) AS three_days,` `COUNT(CASE WHEN first_order_date - registration_date >= INTERVAL '3' day` `AND first_order_date - registration_date < INTERVAL '7' day` `THEN customer_id END) AS first_week,` `COUNT(CASE WHEN first_order_date - registration_date >= INTERVAL '7' day` `THEN customer_id END) AS after_first_week` `FROM customers` `GROUP BY DATE_PART('year', registration_date),` `DATE_PART ('month', registration_date)` `ORDER BY year, month;`
