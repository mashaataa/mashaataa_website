I was born in **Kyiv** (Ukraine) - the capital of great people! Unfortunately, we have a noisy southern neighbor so we are sorry for the inconveniences if you decide to visit Ukraine now.

### Plots

As a data analyst, I am building nice graphs. It is my job to do so. By the way, these are not my graphs.
